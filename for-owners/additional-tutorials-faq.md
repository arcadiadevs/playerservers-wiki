### ~~How to add default plugins which will be added automatically on server creation? - `Experimental, not recommended`~~` ``- REMOVED`

~~In order to do so, you'll need to add their _original name\*_ to the BungeeCord PlayerServers **config.yml** and add all of them to the following directories:~~

~~`BungeeCord -> Plugins -> PlayerServers -> templateplugins`~~

~~`BungeeCord -> Plugins -> PlayerServers -> plugins-to-be-added-ingame`~~

~~By "**original name**" I mean the name written in plugin.yml file of that specific plugin. For instance, the original plugin name for WorldEdit is just WorldEdit, for EssentialsX, it's just EssentialsX, but for some other plugins this might be different. Please be careful while using this option and kindly note that there will be no support for using it, as it's **EXPERIMENTAL** and it may be removed in any of the future updates.~~
