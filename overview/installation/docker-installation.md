# ðŸ›³ Docker configuration

## Introduction

Docker adds a secure isolation layer to your PlayerServers, so you can safely allow players to install all sorts of plugins without being afraid of them breaking something.&#x20;

## Tutorial

### Docker installation

For a quick install of Docker CE, you can execute the command below:

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | CHANNEL=stable bash
```

### Configuration

After successfully installing docker, you can enable docker support inside your config.yml.

{% code title="Config.yml" overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```yaml
docker:
    enabled: true
```
{% endcode %}
