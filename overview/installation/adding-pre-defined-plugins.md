# ðŸ“¦ Adding pre-defined plugins

In order to add plugins to the plugin-installer GUI and make those plugins available to all of your players and their servers, you need to navigate to your BungeeCord plugins folder, than go to the PlayerServers folder, and from there, navigate to the `server-plugins` subfolder.

After that, put the .jar files of all the plugins you want your players to be able to install on their sub-servers.
