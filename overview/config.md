  # Between version v1.2-RC6 and v1.2-RC7 there was a change in
  # Database handling. Everyone upgrading that were satisfied
  # on how it worked before should keep it as false, or first
  # try enabling it and seeing if their servers are still
  # attached to their account or not. In some rare cases it
  # can happen that changing the value of this option can
  # detach servers from your account, so enabling it if it
  # worked correctly for you before is not needed.

# If there are no online players, and the last join was before

launch-command: "screen -dmS %uuid% java -Xmx%mem%M -jar Spigot.jar"

# In how much seconds, after first boot-up of the server should we
# teleport the player to their sub-server? This depends on the strength
# of your machine CPU. If you have a stronger machine, you might wanna set
# it to something like 12 seconds, if you have some kind of Xeon with less
# than 3.9Ghz, you might wanna set this to 15-20 seconds.

ram-limiting:
  # Should we use permissions for ram management? If set to true, you MUST give
  # your players permission playerserver.ram.<amount> (ex: playerserver.ram.512)

  # playerserver.players.unlimited - for unlimited players. If the player
  # has no permission, he'll be able to have unlimited players.
  #
  # NOTE: If you use permissions, and you change player's permissions,
  # their server will need to reboot in order for changes to take place.
