# 5.0 to 6.0

## Introduction

6.0 was probably the biggest update yet, which requires some changes. You can read all of those on our MC-Market [post here](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/15521/update?update=48897), in case you're updating between preview versions. In case you waited for the stable version, here are some info:

## Update process

1. Execute **/ps admin update** in order to update PlayerServerCore
2. Add following three blocks to your config.yml file

```yaml
player-limiting:
  # Should we use permissions for max-players management? If set to true, your
  # players should have playerserver.players.<amount>. The max amount of players
  # that you could give to a single server is 100000. You can also give them
  # playerserver.players.unlimited - for unlimited players. If the player
  # has no permission, he'll be able to have unlimited players.
  use-permissions: false

  # What is the max players each server should have?
  max-players-per-server: 20
```

```yaml
build-tools:
  # Should we log build-tools console output? Highly recommended to set
  # to true, as it will help me a lot with potential issues.
  build-tools-debug: true

  # What version should we build for PlayerServers?
  # Do "latest" for latest, do "1.8.8" for 1.8.8, etc.
  # If you want to change the sub-servers version,
  # you will have to delete templates/Spigot.jar first,
  # and than reboot the server. Btw, it is highly
  # recommended to use 1.8.8 for sub-servers.
  build-version: "1.8.8"
```

```yaml
plugin-limiting:
  # Should we use permissions for max-plugins management? If set to true, your
  # players should have playerserver.plugins.<amount>. The max amount of plugins
  # that you could give to a single server is 20000. You can also give them
  # playerserver.plugins.unlimited - for unlimited plugins. If the player
  # has no permission, he'll be able to have unlimited players.
  #
  # NOTE: If you use permissions, and you change player's permissions,
  # their server will need to reboot in order for changes to take place.
  use-permissions: false

  # What is the max players each server should have?
  max-plugins-per-server: 20
```
