# v1.1 to v1.2

{% hint style="success" %}
Great, you're done! If you use multi-node as well, continue reading below to learn how to update it as well.
{% endhint %}

## Updating Daemon

With the new Daemon, a new Templates system from v1.2 comes as well. In the template named "Default" (located in Daemon/templates/default - which SHOULD be automatically generated after you run Daemon v1.1 for the first time), please insert at least Spigot.jar. Should you wish to edit the template further, please add any plugins/worlds to it as well.
